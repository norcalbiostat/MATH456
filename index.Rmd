    - you know what your data consists of
    - you have gotten it into R and started exploring/visualizing/cleaning
    - you should be starting to do bivariate comparisons at this point

    - and that EVERYONE is contributing. Everyone must share in the presentation

### `r format(wk1.date+1*7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Refresher on Linear regression modeling.


* The main goal this week is to refresh/learn how to interpret all types of predictors in a linear regression model. 
* You'll get your first experience conducting a peer review also this wek. 
* Review the course notes and corresponding textbook chapters before class.

HW01 is not a "linear" homework in that early questions are on topics early in the module, and later questions on later topics. Questions have various parts, some of which aren't discussed directly in class until later. You may not be able to complete all parts of all questions until the end of this module. Do what you can. 

**General Guidance on Homework**  

* Start early and do what you can. If you have any question about the length, or difficulty of my homework assignments and why you should procrastinate at your own peril, just ask any of my prior students. 
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. It is essential to your learning. This is a judgement free class as clearly stated in the [[code of conduct]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH456/syllabus_456_S20.html#policies) section of the syllabus. 
* Spell check your work, and for petes sake look at your work before you turn it in and imagine if you had to print it out. 
    - No 100 page documents because you accidentally printed out the whole data set. 
    - Make sure all code is showing and readable
    - Make sure all text is readable and not sucked into a table or wrapping off the page. 
* All data sets referenced for the homework can be obtained from Dr. D's [[data website]](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/cleaned_data/). 
* Don't assume the data are clean. 
    - Check the data type in R, versus the codebook.
* We will be using the following data sets regularly: Depression, Lung function, Parental HIV. 
    - For each data set we use you should maintain:
        1. the raw data
        2. the codebook
        3. a data management file
        4. a clean data set that is used for homework

The following file organization is recommended. Another option could be to have a subfolder for each data set.

```

  | - data/
        | - lung_081217.txt
        | - dm_lung.R (or .Rmd)
        | - lung_clean.Rdata
        | - depress_081217.txt

* Software Updates: 
    - Update your version of `R studio` for sure. Update R if you're running < 3.5. 
* If you've had me in a class before, you know that there *will* be typos and broken links on this webpage. Here is how you can contribute to the fix.
    - good: Notify me in the `#general` channel in Slack. That way I can confirm in public when the issue is resolved. 
    - better: open up an Issue in Github

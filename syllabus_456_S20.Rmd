# Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  

* Prepare data for analysis by cleaning and transforming raw data. 
* Perform research in a reproducible manner. 
* Apply advanced statistical analysis methodologies to complex and multivariate data. 
* Appropriately conduct an analysis in the presence of missing data. 
* Report the results of the analysis in plain language. 
* Work collaboratively on a team based project. 


# Required Materials
* **Textbook**: _Practical Multivariate Analysis 6th Edition_. Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark ISBN-13: 978-1138702226 
  - 6th edition is necessary
  - Several copies are available in the library. More can be made available if needed. 
* **Reliable Laptop**: Expect to bring often. Contact me if this poses a problem or concern for you. 
* **Reliable internet** connection while on and off campus. ITSS can help you get this setup. 
* **Computer Software:** Unless you have been granted an exception, all work is be done in R. Exceptions are granted on an individual basis after demonstration of proficiency in an alternate language and the ability to produce a reproducible PDF report similar to a R Markdown file.

# Tentative topic list

* Multiple Linear Regression Model building 
    - moderators, confounders, interactions, stratification
    - categorical variables, reference coding, contrasts
* Variable selection methods
* Multivariate statistics / Dimension Reduction
    - Principle Component Analysis
    - Factor Analysis
* Missing Data: Identification & Imputation
* Classification & Prediction
    - Sensitivity/specificity/accuracy
* Optional Topics. At least one of the following topics will also be covered. 
    - Cluster analysis
    - Analysis of Survival Data
    - Generalized linear models / modeling of count data. 


# Assignments / graded items
I will endeavor to have these items loaded into the gradebook in Blackboard Learn ASAP so you can use that as a manner to "check off" the assignments. 

* 2 Exams (midterm/final, not cumulative). [Error Assessment Form](notes/Analyzing exam errors.pdf) available for midterm. 
* 6 standard homework assignments on the topics listed above. Submitted through Google Drive. 
    - Peer reviews (PR) of these assignments. 
* 7 Individual + Group quizzes. Administered through Google Forms, lowest score dropped. 
* Some in-class worksheets on an as-needed basis. 
* Various active or reflective [learning activities](learning_tools.html) during/outside of class.
* Attending [Community Coding](http://bit.ly/cc_hours) and/or Office Hours **4** times
* Attending an internal/external seminar talk on a topic in Applied Statistics, or a Data analysis-centric seminar talk, writing a 1 page summary about the talk, and sharing this summary in the #external-learning Slack channel.
* Contribute to the [Applied Statistics Course Notes](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/). This could be a new example, enhancing/fixing an old example, 
    - Once you identify the piece you want to work on, PM me the section in Slack. I will send you the relevant code/data. 
    - Any student in my ADS class must make their edits using a PR. (If you use GitHub but are not in 485, you are free to use a PR as well.)
* Student Group led analysis [project](project.html). 
* Slack participation. There are 30+ of you, and only 1 of me. Contributing to our learning community by asking and answering questions about assignments, code, etc in Slack is required to make this class run smoothly. And in the end, you are the ones that will benefit from it the most. Don't spend more than 20 min banging your head on the proverbial wall before you reach out and ask for help. 


# Grading

Your final grade will be a straight sum of points earned and will be displayed as a running total in Blackboard Learn. The approximate contributions per category are: 

* Active Learning 25% (Slack, PR, LJ)
* Assignments 25%
* Quizzes 15%
* Exams 20%
* Project 15% 

I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90%: A, 89-80%: B, 79-70%: C, 69-60%: D, 0-59%: F

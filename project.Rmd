Projects this semester will be user generated. They must entail a sufficient amount of data exploration and modeling, and require some sort of modeling technique that we cover in this class (missing data, survival data, clustered or correlated data, classification/prediction, multivariate analysis.)

* Graduate research? 
* Senior project? 
* Have an advisor with data/questions to ask and not enough time to investigate?
* Just want to poke around with some data and see what you can find out? 
* The subject field is up to you! 


# Team Recruitment

Proposers must create a 2-3 minute "elevator pitch" video about their data and project. Post this video on youtube and put the link in the `#projects` Slack channel by the due date. 

* Then everyone else reviews the proposals and submit their desired project rankings/preferences that they would like to work on. 
* I will post at least one external collaborator proposal to ensure that there are enough projects to go around. These may be slightly more "work intensive" given that you won't have a subject matter expert as a team lead, but you will benefit from engaging in a much more realistic consulting experience. This is what you will often experience in the workforce as an analyst.

Small teams (2-3) will be formed to work on these projects throughout the semester. 

* I will try my absolute best to assign people to the project they are most interested in. 
* You will have your own private Slack channel for you to collaborate in.  
* The project lead (the person with the data) is responsible for keeping the analysis moving forward, educating their teammates on the scientific context of the research, responsible for the majority of the contextual writing. 
* Project members are responsible for asking questions to understand the scientific context, providing assistance with programming and analysis, writing the data analysis and results sections of the report 
* If you are working with an external collaborator there is a slightly reduced expectation for a clear explanation as to the implications of your research (and other domain specific information). You will need to arrange regular meeting times with them. I will facilitate the initial meeting to make some ground rules clear that protect both them, and your, expectations and workload. 

You will mostly work independently on your projects throughout the semester, but I will try to set aside some class sessions that are set aside as open work time.  

# Deliverables

Summary

* Project proposal to Dr. D. 
* Team recruitment video
* Students select projects
* Groups write up team agreements, task distributions, and a project timeline. 
* Week 8: Project update (1 pg summary + 5 min presentation by project lead)
* Week 12: Draft report
* Week 15: Project presentations, Final report


## Written proposal due to Dr. D for approval

Short summary of your research topic that includes: 

* Purpose: Senior project, graduate thesis, independent research, just for fun
* How much work you have done already on this analysis. 
* Data source: If the internet, you must provide a link, a codebook and/or a sample of the data. 
* The research question(s) at hand
* What statistical analyses topic that we cover this semester is this aligned with? 
* What you hope to accomplish, i.e. how will you use your team time? 

## Team Recruitment Video 

* Create a <5 minute video and post on YouTube. Link this in the #projects slack channel. 
  - Need help finding video equipment? Ask in the #projects channel. 
  
## Project Selection

* Use this link [(TBD)]() to choose your top three projects. 
    - Everyone (proposers and non-proposers) must make this selection. 
* Not all projects will be "funded" 
    - not all projects will have enough interest from other students to warrant a team

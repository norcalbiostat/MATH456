<li>Discussion boards &amp; Discord participation. Contributing to our
learning community by asking and answering questions about assignments,
code, etc in Discord is required to make this class run smoothly. And in

spend more than 20 min banging your head on the proverbial wall before
you reach out and ask for help.</li>
<li>One external activity. Because no academic topic only lives in the
classroom. Examples include:
<ul>
<li>Attending an internal/external seminar talk on a topic in Applied
Statistics, or a Data analysis-centric seminar talk, writing a 1 page
summary about the talk and how it relates to this class or your chosen
field, and sharing this summary in the #external-learning Discord
channel.</li>
<li>Contribute to the <a
href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/">Applied
Statistics Course Notes</a>. This could be a new example or
enhancing/fixing an old example

<h1>Class Policies and statements</h1>
<div id="everyone-is-welcome-here" class="section level2">
<h2>Everyone is welcome here</h2>
<p>It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>I would like to create a learning environment that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability,
etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ
from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point
to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want
to be called. - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately
as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to
honor your name.</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and
talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule
and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general
announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the
Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu"
class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about
diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
(Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica
Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on
lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area,
the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with
this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our
campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda
people for centuries.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance</h2>
<p>Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to
miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason,
DM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms
<strong>DO NOT COME TO CLASS</strong>. DM me in Discord we’ll make a
backup plan.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="late-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Late work</h2>
<ul>
<li>You should strive to submit on time for all draft items the sake of
your peers. Do you want your reviews back in a timely manner? You should
show them the same courtesy and professionalism.</li>
<li>I don’t penalize for late work, but I prioritize on time
submissions. If you submit an assignment after i’m done grading everyone
elses, and we’re moving on to the next topic then your assignment may
have to wait a long time before I can get back to it.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="collaboration" class="section level2">
<h2>Collaboration</h2>
<p>Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when
they have someone else to talk through concepts with.</p>
<div class="callout-warning">
<p>Collaboration on exams is not allowed.</p>

<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p>The CSU requires students to be fully vaccinated and boosted against
COVID-19 by February 28th, 2022, unless you have an approved exemption.
While Chico State has relaxed its stance on mask mandates, this is still
a real pressing problem.<br />
* I recognize that we all have different levels of risk we are willing
to take ourselves, and different risk management strategies. * I
personally am working on reducing my mask wearing, but I also have
immunocompromised elderly mother at home. * Masks will ALWAYS be welcome
and respected in this classroom. No questions. * I am likely to request
masks be worn in my office. * Please keep up to date with available
booster shots. You can’t learn if you’re ill.  * If you have COVID
symptoms, :x: Do not come to class. I’ll turn on Zoom for the day so you
can participate. * If you are just generally feeling unwell, please use
a mask. I will always have some on hand.</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of
adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness,
respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of
behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action.
Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or
plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at <a
href="https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml"
class="uri">https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml</a> if you
have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of
violating academic integrity.</p>

* Attending [Community Coding](http://bit.ly/cc_hours) and/or Office Hours **2** times. This can be to check in on your grade, ask clarifying questions, or chat about life and graduate school.
* Discussion boards & Discord participation. Contributing to our learning community by asking and answering questions about assignments, code, etc in Discord is required to make this class run smoothly. And in the end, you are the ones that will benefit from it the most. Don't spend more than 20 min banging your head on the proverbial wall before you reach out and ask for help. 


# General Guidance on Homework

* Start early and do what you can. If you have any question about the length, or difficulty of my homework assignments and why you should procrastinate at your own peril, just ask any of my prior students.
* Ask questions! It is essential to your learning.
* Spell check your work, and for petes sake look at your work before you turn it in and imagine if you had to print it out.
    - No 100 page documents because you accidentally printed out the whole data set.
    - Make sure all code is showing and readable
    - Make sure all text is readable and not sucked into a table or wrapping off the page.

# Class Policies and statements

## Everyone is welcome here

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let me know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

I would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

-  Let me know if you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records. I make it a point to call on people by name, so please make sure that I know what you want to be called. 
        - I also want to try to pronounce your name as accurately as possible. The more you help and correct me the better I can do to honor your name. 
-   If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with me. I want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback using the feedback button on the schedule and help pages of the website (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
-   If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email [diversityoffice\@csuchico.edu](mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu){.email}
-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).

*Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)*.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda. I recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land and the waters that run through campus. I am humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that once sustained the Mechoopda people for centuries.



## Attendance

Class attendance is expected. Talk to me ahead of time if you need to miss a class for a planned reason. In the event of an unplanned reason, DM me in Discord when you can so that I know you are still alive. 


### COVID-19 

-   Like it or not, it's here to stay. We all have different levels of risk we are willing to take ourselves, and different risk management strategies.
-   Masks will ALWAYS be welcome and respected in this classroom. No questions.
-   Please keep up to date with available booster shots. You can't learn if you're ill.
-   If you are just generally feeling unwell, please use a mask. I will always have some on hand.

> If you are not feeling well or are experiencing Covid symptoms DM me in Discord we'll make a backup plan so you can rest while protecting your classmates. 



## Late work

In general, work isn't considered 'Late' until someone is waiting for you. This means there is little grace period for draft assignments. Do you want your reviews back in a timely manner? You should show them the same courtesy and professionalism. 
    
If I have to pester you several times to submit your work, or you submit your work after I'm done grading the rest of the class, not only will it take longer for me to get feedback to you, it will receive a 10% penalty.  


## Collaboration

Collaboration on assignments is encouraged. People learn better when they have someone else to talk through concepts with. 

**Collaboration on exams is not allowed.**

## Peer Reviews

If you consistently do not turn in draft assignments that is complete enough for a review, or consistently provide sub-par reviews to your classmates, I reserve the right to stop assigning you work to review and stop having your work reviewed. You will not have the ability to make up these points. 

## Use of AI

As an instructor I recognize there are a variety of AI programs available to assist in creating text and writing code. However, I want to stress that, AI programs are not a replacement for human creativity, originality, and critical thinking. Writing (text and code) is a skill that you must nurture over time in order to develop your own individual voice, style, and view.  

The use of chat GPT is allowed/encouraged **to help you learn how to code** but all code used must be fully explained in text. We will cover what this means and how to do this when we start data management around week 3. [How ChatGPT can help you write code](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-to-use-chatgpt-to-write-code/)

You are responsible for fact checking the accuracy of statements composed by AI language models. 

#### Be up front!

When presenting text written by Artificial intelligence (AI) language models, such as ChatGPT, you must include an appropriate citation. [https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt](https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt)

This also goes for when you have it write code for you. You need to indicate when and where you used it.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity is defined as “a commitment, even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, trust, fairness, respect, and responsibility”. From these values flow principles of behavior that enable academic communities to translate ideals to action. Academic integrity is expected and required. No forms of cheating or plagiarism will be tolerated. Please see your student handbook at https://www.csuchico.edu/scrr/integrity.shtml if you have questions about the meaning of these terms or the consequences of violating academic integrity.

## Learning Journals (LJ)
An electronic document where you will be writing responses and reflections to certain in-class activities. This will be checked off quarterly for quality and completeness. 

https://www.teachthought.com/literacy/20-types-of-learning-journals-that-help-students-think/

* Date each entry. Write entries in chronoligcal order, from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom. 
* If you find it getting lengthy, you can use first or second level headers to create a navigation bar/outline view to the left side to help find specific entries. 


[[Here is the list]](hw/lj-entries.html) of LJ entries to date. 



## Question Formulation Technique (QFT)
The backbone of the scientific process is asking and trying to answer questions. This activity will help students learn how to brainstorm and ask questions freely, how to work with open and close ended questions, and what they can learn from asking questions. 

**General process**: 

1. You will be presented with a Question Focus. 
2. In a group you will produce questions about the focus topic using some guiding rules. 
3. Identify closed and open ended questions, practice converting between the two. 
4. Prioritize questions (Mark with an "X")
5. In a shared Google document: 
    - Share questions converted from open to closed, and closed to open format. 
    - Your top 3 questions, with rational for their ranking. 
6. (After class) Reflect on the activity in your Learning Journal. 
    - Review the class-wide responses and comment on similarities and differences between your group and other groups top 3.
    - Think about the work that you have done, what you have learned and its value. 
    - What did you learn during this exercise? 
    - What is the value of learning to ask your own questions? 
    - How can you use what you learned?

## Peer Review (PR)

No matter what you end up doing after graduation, the quality of your ideas and work will be judged, in a large measure, by how well you can communicate in writing to diverse audiences. Participating in peer review can help you learn to shape their written language as a medium of communication with readers. [[Ref.]](https://teachingcenter.wustl.edu/resources/writing-assignments-feedback/using-peer-review-to-help-students-improve-their-writing/)

You will be providing peer reviews on different assignments, including homework and project assignments. 

Most assignments will have a Draft due date. Then a period of peer review for approx 2 days, where your job is to help your classmate get the best score possible. Then after the peer review window has closed, you have another 1-2 days to make corrections and submit your final version. 

Details on requirements, and grading of reviews can be found in this [linked Google Document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eAe2joBOQ_RGkYi9k3LPBAiaclhjLoXBJdsOu1f4xrs)



## Quizzes (Qz)
Quizzes are a great way to test yourself, enhance recall, and self-assess your comprehension of the subject. Quizzes are administered in Google Forms, and done in two parts.

1. **Individual**: First try to answer as many questions without looking at your notes. Then use your notes to answer the rest. 

2. **Group**: After the individual quiz closes I will choose 1-4 questions that scored the lowest. We will do a class-wide discussion of those topics, then you will work in groups to redo the selected questions for half credit. 


## Exam Error Assessment

For the midterm you will have an opportunity assess your errors on the midterm, make corrections, review the corrections with me, for a partial return of the credit lost. [Error Assessment Form](notes/Analyzing exam errors.pdf)

* Download the error assessment form. 
* Review page 3, six types of test taking errors. 
* Fill out page 2 by using the commenting/editing tool in Adobe to add text.
* Redo the problems you got wrong on a separate form. 
* Make an appt with me to go over your corrected answers.

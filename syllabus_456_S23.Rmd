# Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:  

* Prepare data for analysis by cleaning and transforming raw data. 
* Perform research in a reproducible manner. 
* Apply advanced statistical analysis methodologies to complex and multivariate data. 
* Appropriately conduct an analysis in the presence of missing data. 
* Report the results of the analysis in plain language. 


# Required Materials
* **Textbook**: _Practical Multivariate Analysis 6th Edition_. Afifi, May, Donatello, Clark ISBN-13: 978-1138702226 
  - 6th edition is necessary
  - Several copies are available in the library. More can be made available if needed. 
* **Reliable Laptop**: Expect to bring often. Contact me if this poses a problem or concern for you. 
* **Reliable internet** connection while on and off campus. ITSS can help you get this setup. 
* **Computer Software:** Unless you have been granted an exception, all work is be done in R. Exceptions are granted on an individual basis after demonstration of proficiency in an alternate language and the ability to produce a reproducible PDF report similar to a R Markdown file and produce readable & annotated code.

# Tentative topic list

* Multiple Linear Regression Model building 
    - categorical variables, reference coding
    - moderators, confounders, interactions, stratification
    - Variable selection methods
* Classification & Prediction
    - Sensitivity/specificity/accuracy
* Multivariate statistics / Dimension Reduction
    - Principle Component Analysis
    - Factor Analysis
* Missing Data: Identification & Imputation
* Additional Topics. 1-2 of the following topics will also be covered. 
    - Cluster analysis
    - Analysis of Survival Data
    - Generalized linear models / modeling of count data. 
    - Correlated outcomes (Multi-level models)
    - Bootstrap methods


# Assignments / graded items 
Your final grade will be a straight sum of points earned and will be displayed as a running total in Canvas. 
I use a standard grade cutoff of 100-90%: A, 89-80%: B, 79-70%: C, 69-60%: D, 0-59%: F  


#### Exams (25%)
* 2 Exams (midterm/final, not cumulative). [Error Assessment Form](notes/Analyzing exam errors.pdf) available for midterm. 

#### Assignments (30%)
* 6 Standard homework assignments on the topics listed above. Drafts submitted through Google Drive, Final versions for grading submitted through Canvas. 

#### Quizzes (15%)
* Nearly weekly Individual + Group quizzes. Administered through Google Forms. Lowest score dropped. 

#### Active Learning (30%)
* Various active or reflective [learning activities](learning_tools.html) during/outside of class.
* Peer reviews (PR) of assignments. Because helping others helps you learn. 
* Attending [Community Coding](http://bit.ly/cc_hours) and/or Office Hours **2** times. This can be to check in on your grade, ask clarifying questions, or chat about life and graduate school.
* Discord participation. Contributing to our learning community by asking and answering questions about assignments, code, etc in Discord is required to make this class run smoothly. And in the end, you are the ones that will benefit from it the most. Don't spend more than 20 min banging your head on the proverbial wall before you reach out and ask for help. 
* One external activity. Because no academic topic only lives in the classroom. Examples include:
    -  Attending an internal/external seminar talk on a topic in Applied Statistics, or a Data analysis-centric seminar talk, writing a 1 page summary about the talk and how it relates to this class or your chosen field, and sharing this summary in the #external-learning Discord channel.
    - Contribute to the [Applied Statistics Course Notes](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/AppliedStatistics_notes/). This could be a new example or  enhancing/fixing an old example
        - Once you identify the piece you want to work on, PM me the section in Discord I will send you the relevant code/data.

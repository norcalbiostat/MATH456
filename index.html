    - Attending at least one session will earn credit towards your grade. 
    - Fill out [this survey](https://goo.gl/forms/dXUP2YevwGfbsbVM2) to tell me when you are free. 


### Week 14 (4/30 - 5/6)
* Poster Session on Monday
* Upload final poster (as printed) to the Projects/CNS Posters FINAL folder in Google Drive
* Wed/Friday continue with Missing Data lecture



### Week 13 (4/23 - 4/29)
* **FINALLY** you get to learn why I harp on you about missing data. 
* Monday: We'll use the QFT to develop questions about the impacts of missing data, and then talk about how to identify when data are missing. 
* Wednesday we'll discuss the mechanisms in which data can dissapear, and some common methods to address/eliminate the bias created due to missing data. 
* Friday is an open work day because I want to see a draft of your posters by Friday EOD. 
  - Poster Prep Guidance: 
      - https://www.csuchico.edu/nsci/event/poster.shtml 
      - https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/lec/poster_guidelines/
    
 
#### POSTER PRESENTATION HELD ON MONDAY
* Yes they must be printed. Use a template provided on either of the guideline pages. 
* Yes this is a serious professional event that can go on your CV. 
* Yes you must dress professionally.
* Yes your poster will be judged by peers and professionals alike. 
* Yes I must see the poster before printing. 
* Yes at least one person must be at your poster between 12:30 and 2:30 pm. 
    - Whomever is putting up the poster between 10 and 11 that morning must check in with me and provide me your group's presentation schedule. Each person should plan to stand at their poster for at minimum 30 minutes. 
    - I **will** check up on you. Unless previously cleared by me, this should not fall to one person. 
* Upload the PDF or PPT of your poster _as printed_ to the Projects/NSC Posters folder in our Google Drive. 


> Blackboard gradebook has been updated to include poster session attendance. 
> Final grade breakdown is 500 pts, 24% homework, 20% learning (peer review, QFT), 40% exams, 16% project. 
     





### Week 12 (4/16 - 4/22)
* Spatial data analysis!
* Making maps is probably the most fun part.
    - Of course there is a bazillion ways & packages to accomplish this task. 
* Want more? Check out courses in our Geography department. 


### Week 11 (4/9 - 4/15)
* We're going through a superficial treatment of longitudinal data.
* This topic is worthy of it's own 10 week course and the topic of NUMEROUS texts. 
* This is also SET week - we will be doing ours in person on Friday. 
    - Attendance is mandatory and will count towards your grade. 
* Next week is Spatial modeling - so my advice is to get started on the assignment ASAP. 
    - I will try to leave time during class for open work this week but cannot guarantee it. I don't want to rush through the material. 
    

### Week 10 (4/2 - 4/8)
* Abstract submissions for the [[College of Natural Science Poster Session]](https://www.csuchico.edu/nsci/event/poster.shtml) are open until April 16th 
    - Submission is a mandatory assignment for this class
* We're going to finish talking about the Random Intercept model this week
    - the common methods of fitting these models in R
    - and some common methods of handling covariates in multilevel models. 
* The schedule has been updated to reflect the "surprise" holiday last Friday, and the change in poster session date. 
    - The final date has been posted, along with information about the take home portion of the final. 
    

### Week 9 (3/26 - 4/1)
* Exam corrections - Must use error assessment document. A copy can be found [[here]](notes/analyzingexamerrors.pdf) and also in the #general channel in Slack. 
* Starting a section on correlated data. QFT on Monday, lecture wed, open work day Friday. 
* Grading status: Gradebook will be fully updated by Tuesday. 


### Week 8 (3/12 - 3/16)
* Fast forwarding...
* **Midterm** this week! 60% in class, 40% take home. 
    - Midterm review on Monday. 
    - Class generated using QFT model of question formulation
    - This is worth participation points, so be there and contribute!
    - Midterm materials allowed: 2 pages of notes & a calculator. 
* Take home portion with instructions posted in Slack `#assignments` channel by EOB (end of business).
* **Project updates** - this is worth 20 pts, so make it good. You have 4-5 minutes and 3-4 slides to show me that
    - you know what your data consists of
    - you have gotten it into R and started exploring/visualizing/cleaning
    - you should be starting to do bivariate comparisons at this point
    - you have a clear idea of what model you are working towards
    - and that EVERYONE is contributing. Everyone must share in the presentation

<div id="report-appearance" class="section level4">
<h4>Report appearance</h4>
<p>In a professional world, it is not just the correctness/quality of your work, but how you present the results. There are several packages in R that help you with this by writing the HTML or LaTeX code for you.</p>
<p>When looking for some updated references so I could write a list for you, I came across <a href="https://jrnold.github.io/intro-methods-notes/formatting-tables.html">[these course notes]</a> by <a href="https://github.com/jrnold">Dr. Jeffrey Arnold</a> taht does a good job (even if it’s from 2018) of giving a list of packages, and examples of a few. I noticed that these notes also do a good job of explaining regression modeling concepts. There is a lot more to talk about than what I can go through this semester.</p>
<p><strong>See new code at end of logistic regression section of ASCN</strong></p>
<p>I highly recommend looking into the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html">[kableExtra]</a> package for most things related to printing nice table (not raw regression output).</p>

<div id="refresher-on-linear-regression-modeling." class="section level3">
<h3>01-27-2020: Refresher on Linear regression modeling.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The main goal this week is to refresh/learn how to interpret all types of predictors in a linear regression model.</li>
<li>You’ll get your first experience conducting a peer review also this wek.</li>
<li>Review the course notes and corresponding textbook chapters before class.</li>
</ul>
<p>HW01 is not a “linear” homework in that early questions are on topics early in the module, and later questions on later topics. Questions have various parts, some of which aren’t discussed directly in class until later. You may not be able to complete all parts of all questions until the end of this module. Do what you can.</p>
<p><strong>General Guidance on Homework</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Start early and do what you can. If you have any question about the length, or difficulty of my homework assignments and why you should procrastinate at your own peril, just ask any of my prior students.</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to ask questions. It is essential to your learning. This is a judgement free class as clearly stated in the <a href="https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH456/syllabus_456_S20.html#policies">[code of conduct]</a> section of the syllabus.</li>
<li>Spell check your work, and for petes sake look at your work before you turn it in and imagine if you had to print it out.
<ul>
<li>No 100 page documents because you accidentally printed out the whole data set.</li>
<li>Make sure all code is showing and readable</li>
<li>Make sure all text is readable and not sucked into a table or wrapping off the page.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>All data sets referenced for the homework can be obtained from Dr. D’s <a href="https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/cleaned_data/">[data website]</a>.</li>
<li>Don’t assume the data are clean.
<ul>
<li>Check the data type in R, versus the codebook.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We will be using the following data sets regularly: Depression, Lung function, Parental HIV.
<ul>
<li>For each data set we use you should maintain:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>the raw data</li>
<li>the codebook</li>
<li>a data management file</li>
<li>a clean data set that is used for homework</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The following file organization is recommended. Another option could be to have a subfolder for each data set.</p>
<pre><code>math456/
  | - data/
        | - lung_081217.txt
        | - dm_lung.R (or .Rmd)

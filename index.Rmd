* This is also SET week - we will be doing ours in person on Friday. 
    - Attendance is mandatory and will count towards your grade. 
* Next week is Spatial modeling - so my advice is to get started on the assignment ASAP. 
    - I will try to leave time during class for open work this week but cannot guarantee it. I don't want to rush through the material. 
    

### Week 10 (4/2 - 4/8)

* Starting a section on correlated data. QFT on Monday, lecture wed, open work day Friday. 
* Grading status: Gradebook will be fully updated by Tuesday. 


### Week 8 (3/12 - 3/16)
* Fast forwarding...
* **Midterm** this week! 60% in class, 40% take home. 
    - Midterm review on Monday. 
    - Class generated using QFT model of question formulation
    - This is worth participation points, so be there and contribute!
    - Midterm materials allowed: 2 pages of notes & a calculator. 
* Take home portion with instructions posted in Slack `#assignments` channel by EOB (end of business).
* **Project updates** - this is worth 20 pts, so make it good. You have 4-5 minutes and 3-4 slides to show me that
    - you know what your data consists of
    - you have gotten it into R and started exploring/visualizing/cleaning
    - you should be starting to do bivariate comparisons at this point
    - you have a clear idea of what model you are working towards
    - and that EVERYONE is contributing. Everyone must share in the presentation

### `r format(wk1.date+5*7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Missing Data: Identification and Imputation

* HW 01 feedback started. Please review for general info that applies to all HW. 
* Quiz 2 posted. Individual due Tuesday 2/25, Group on Wednesday. 
* HW 03 posted. Short turn around time on it, check the calendar. 
* QFT on Monday - don't forget the learning journal reflection afterward. 




### `r format(wk1.date+4*7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Classification and Prediction

* The Learning Journal section on the [Learning Tools](learning_tools.html) page has been updated to contain information on what LJ entries were assigned. I will update this on a more regular basis going forward. 

#### PROJECT UPDATE
* Project selection is over! Thank you to all who contributed project proposals. 
    - All student proposals were funded!
    - You all have been assigned to either your 1st or 2nd choices.
    - Those that didn't respond to the project selection form were placed on teams of my choosing. 
* You have been placed in a private Slack channel with your team members. 
* Check the Project page for details on your next deliverables (this week)


#### Report appearance

In a professional world, it is not just the correctness/quality of your work, but how you present the results. 
There are several packages in R that help you with this by writing the HTML or LaTeX code for you. 

When looking for some updated references so I could write a list for you, I came across [[these course notes]](https://jrnold.github.io/intro-methods-notes/formatting-tables.html) by [Dr. Jeffrey Arnold](https://github.com/jrnold) taht does a good job (even if it's from 2018) of giving a list of packages, and examples of a few. I noticed that these notes also do a good job of explaining regression modeling concepts. There is a lot more to talk about than what I can go through this semester.

**See new code at end of logistic regression section of ASCN**

I highly recommend looking into the [[kableExtra]](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kableExtra/vignettes/awesome_table_in_html.html) package for most things related to printing nice table (not raw regression output).


<!---
* No new content this week. Working/practicing your model writing and calculating various classification measurements. 
* Wednesday worksheet: [Classifying Glass](notes/classifying glass.Rmd)

### `r format(wk1.date+3*7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Modeling Binary Outcomes

* Little bit of recap on regression modeling for a continuous outcome, before we get into what to do when your outcome isn't continuous. 
* We are going to only discuss the case when your outcome is binary, by fitting a Logistic regression model.


* Quiz 1 is due by Monday 1pm
* Draft of HW1 is due by Sunday EOD
* Peer review opens Monday morning, due Wednesday
    - You have 2 assignments to peer review. The rotation sheet has been updated. 


### `r format(wk1.date+2*7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Variable Selection

* I will be reviewing and commenting on project proposals this week. Approved proposals will have until Saturday to create and post a video "pitch" to recruit other students to join their project. 
* Due to the lack of proposals submitted so far, I am extending the proposal deadline until Monday EOD. 
    - Everyone has to work on a project. 
    - I will have several projects proposals for you to choose from. These won't nearly be as much fun or interesting compared to ones that you would choose. 
* You should have started HW1 already. In fact, you should be done with a portion of HW 1 already. Quiz 1 is based on the content covered in HW1, will open Saturday, and close on Sunday EOD. 


### `r format(wk1.date+1*7, "%m-%d-%Y")`: Refresher on Linear regression modeling.


* The main goal this week is to refresh/learn how to interpret all types of predictors in a linear regression model. 
* You'll get your first experience conducting a peer review also this wek. 
* Review the course notes and corresponding textbook chapters before class.

HW01 is not a "linear" homework in that early questions are on topics early in the module, and later questions on later topics. Questions have various parts, some of which aren't discussed directly in class until later. You may not be able to complete all parts of all questions until the end of this module. Do what you can. 

**General Guidance on Homework**  

* Start early and do what you can. If you have any question about the length, or difficulty of my homework assignments and why you should procrastinate at your own peril, just ask any of my prior students. 
* Don't be afraid to ask questions. It is essential to your learning. This is a judgement free class as clearly stated in the [[code of conduct]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH456/syllabus_456_S20.html#policies) section of the syllabus. 
* Spell check your work, and for petes sake look at your work before you turn it in and imagine if you had to print it out. 
    - No 100 page documents because you accidentally printed out the whole data set. 
    - Make sure all code is showing and readable
    - Make sure all text is readable and not sucked into a table or wrapping off the page. 
* All data sets referenced for the homework can be obtained from Dr. D's [[data website]](https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/data/cleaned_data/). 
* Don't assume the data are clean. 
    - Check the data type in R, versus the codebook.
* We will be using the following data sets regularly: Depression, Lung function, Parental HIV. 
    - For each data set we use you should maintain:
        1. the raw data
        2. the codebook
        3. a data management file
        4. a clean data set that is used for homework

The following file organization is recommended. Another option could be to have a subfolder for each data set.

```
math456/
  | - data/
        | - lung_081217.txt
        | - dm_lung.R (or .Rmd)
        | - lung_clean.Rdata
        | - depress_081217.txt
        | - dm_depress.R
        | - depress_clean.Rdata
  | - hw/
      | - hw01-modeling-userid.Rmd
      | - hw01-modeling-userid.pdf

    - You will be sent an invite link to your @mail.csuchico.edu email address. Accept and join the workspace by Wednesday. 
* Software Updates: 
    - Update your version of `R studio` for sure. Update R if you're running < 3.5. 
* If you've had me in a class before, you know that there *will* be typos and broken links on this webpage. Here is how you can contribute to the fix.
    - good: Notify me in the `#general` channel in Slack. That way I can confirm in public when the issue is resolved. 
    - better: open up an Issue in Github

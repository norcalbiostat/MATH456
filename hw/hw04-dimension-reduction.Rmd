This assignment uses the `depression` and `parental hiv` data sets, and the [factoextra](http://www.sthda.com/english/articles/31-principal-component-methods-in-r-practical-guide/112-pca-principal-component-analysis-essentials
) package. 


# Principal Components


## 1. PMA6 14.1 (modified): For the depression data set, perform a PCA on the last seven variables `DRINK-CHRONILL`. 
Use the _covariance_ matrix, but *do not center or scale* the data. You should have the codebook for this data set open during this homework. 

### a) Select the relevant variables and ensure their data type is numeric. 


### b) Generate the PC's using `princomp`, use the loading values to write out the equations for the first two PC's. 


### c) Use the output from `summary` and `get_eigenvalue` to determine the number of PC's to retain that contain 80% of the original variance. 


### d) Create TWO biplots using both `biplot` and/or `fviz_pca_biplot`; 1) of PC's 1 & 2, 2) of two other PC's (e.g. 3 and 4, or 3 and 5....). Use these biplots to start to interpret the correlations between the PC's (dims) and the original variables. 


## 2. Repeat question #1b-d using the correlation matrix instead of the covariance matrix. 
Compare the results and comment. (Are the same number of PC's retained? Are the loadings different?)

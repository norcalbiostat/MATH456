# Overview

Together with a partner you will brainstorm together to create a flowchart of steps that you should take to prepare data for analysis. 

Use PMA6 Chapter 3 and ASCN Chapter 1 as reference guides for things to keep in mind while preparing data for analysis. 

After class you will take your collaborative work, transfer this work into electronic format and make it your own personal document.

## Overview

Projects this semester will be user generated. They must entail a sufficient amount of data exploration and modeling, and require some sort of modeling technique that we cover in this class (missing data, survival data, clustered or correlated data, classification/prediction, multivariate analysis.)

* Graduate research? 
* Senior project? 
* Have an advisor with data/questions to ask and not enough time to investigate?
* Just want to poke around with some data and see what you can find out? 
* The subject field is up to you! 


## Deliverables

This is a birds eye check list. Details for each stage are below. 

* Week 2: `r emo::ji("heavy_check_mark")` Project proposal to Dr. D.
* Week 3: Team recruitment video
* Week 4: Project selection
* Week 5: Team formation. Groups write up team agreements, task distributions, and a project timeline. 
* Week 8: Project update (1 pg summary + 5 min presentation by project lead)
* Week 12: Draft report
* Week 15: Project presentations, Final report

## Learning objectives

Participating in this project will provide practical experiences in

* Practice team collaboration skills.
* Writing project proposals, explaining your ideas to others
* Convincing others your idea is worth their time. 
* Data wrangling
* Advanced statistical analysis topics
* Presentation (oral and written)
* Creating a project timeline/deadlines. Meeting deliverable deadlines

# Written Proposal

A 1 page written summary of your research topic due to Dr. D for approval that includes the following information. 

* Purpose: Senior project, graduate thesis, independent research, just for fun
* How much work you have done already on this analysis. 
* Data source: If the internet, you must provide a link, a codebook and/or a sample of the data. 
* Data sample: I want to *see* the raw data you intend to analyze. 
* The research question(s) at hand
* What statistical analyses topic that we cover this semester is this aligned with? 
* What you hope to accomplish, i.e. how will you use your team time? 


# Team Recruitment

## Recruitment pitch video

* Put any supplemental materials (such as your edited/revised project proposal and any sample data) in an appropriately named folder in our shared Google Drive (under `projects`)
* Create a ~5 minute "elevator pitch" video about your data and project. Be very clear what your goals are. 
* Upload this video to either A) our google drive or B) YouTube
    - Send the link in the `#projects` Slack channel by the due date. 
  
I will post at least one external collaborator proposal to ensure that there are enough projects to go around. These may be slightly more "work intensive" given that you won't have a subject matter expert as a team lead, but you will benefit from engaging in a much more realistic consulting experience. This is what you will often experience in the workforce as an analyst.

## Project Selection

* Use this link [(TBD)]() to choose your top three projects. 
    - **All students** must select three projects to work on. 
* Not all projects will be "funded" 
    - not all projects will have enough interest from other students to warrant a team


## Team assignment

Small teams (2-3) will be formed to work on these projects throughout the semester. 

* I will try my absolute best to assign people to the project they are most interested in. 
* You will have your own private Slack channel, and a Google Drive folder for you to collaborate in. 
* The project lead (the person with the data) is responsible for keeping the analysis moving forward, educating their teammates on the scientific context of the research, responsible for the majority of the contextual writing. 
* Project members are responsible for asking questions to understand the scientific context, providing assistance with programming and analysis, writing the data analysis and results sections of the report 
* If you are working with an external collaborator there is a slightly reduced expectation for a clear explanation as to the implications of your research (and other domain specific information). You will need to arrange regular meeting times with them. I will facilitate the initial meeting to make some ground rules clear that protect both them, and your, expectations and workload. 

You will mostly work independently on your projects throughout the semester, but I will try to set aside some class sessions that are set aside as open work time.

# Learning Journal Entries

Some entries are completed during class as part of participation and reflection. 
If you did not attend class that day, just say so. Don't try to make up an entry. 


* 1/23 How does the material youâ€™ve heard thus far (from the reading in Homework 00) connect or conflict with your prior knowledge, beliefs, or values?
* 1/27 Linear Regression brain dump. Write down everything you know about Linear Regression 
* 2/13 Read this article on [Effective note taking](https://learningcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/effective-note-taking-in-class/). Self-assess your practice in your LJ. What is your strategy (both format and content) for taking notes during this class? Do you have different practices for different classes? Why do you think that is the case? 
* 02/13 - QFT: How to model binary outcomes
    - Review the class-wide responses and comment on similarities and differences between your group and other groups top 3.
    - Think about the work that you have done, what you have learned and its value. 
    - What is the value of learning to ask your own questions? 
    - How can you use what you learned? 
* 3/26 - We're 2/3 through the semester and this class has a different feel to it from when it started. How are you doing? Not just in the class, but in general? 
* 4/10 - Consider the topics we have covered so far in class: data management, model building, multiple regression, logistic regression, classification, missing data, imputation, dimension reduction, principle components, factor analysis. 
    - How do they relate to each other (aside from they use data & statistics)
    - Give a few examples of when it would be appropriate to use these techniques (name the technique with the example) in your direct field of study/interest area. 
    - How would you know when to use each one? What are the verbal/written clues that you would look for to identify that a particular technique is appropriate in a real life situation (e.g. when someone doesn't tell you "hey go do a PCA... ")
